    "A variable (i.e., name), like a, is created when your code first assigns it a value. Future assignments change the value of the already created name. Technically, Python detects some names before your code runs, but you can think of it as though initial assignments make variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable types\n",
    "A variable never has any type information or constraints associated with it. The notion of type lives with objects, not names. Variables are generic in nature; they always simply refer to a particular object at a particular point in time.\n",
    "### Variable use\n",
    "\n",
    "When a variable appears in an expression, it is immediately replaced with the object that it currently refers to, whatever that may be. Further, all variables must be explicitly assigned before they can be used; referencing unassigned variables results in errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, variables are created when assigned, can reference any type of object, and must be assigned before they are referenced. This means that you never need to declare names used by your script, but you must initialize names before you can update them; coun- ters, for example, must be initialized to zero before you can add to them.\n",

    "1. Create an object to represent the value \n",

    "2. Create the variable a, if it does not yet exist. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are entries in a system table, with spaces for links to objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are pieces of allocated memory, with enough space to represent the values\n",
